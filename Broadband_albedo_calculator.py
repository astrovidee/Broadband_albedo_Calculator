Project description: This code is a python version of ice_gcm.pro which calculates the albedo from stellar 
spectrum and spectrum of reflectance. 
Note: any spectrum file can be used along with any
reflectance spectrum provided the minGrid and maxGrid parameters are changed to reflect the appropriate units. 
Units are not important (as long as the wavelength units are the same for each file) for the 
final albedo calculations since it is normalized by both the wavelength and the stellar spectrum.
Required Inputs:
    stellarfile = file containing two columns:
                         1 - wavelength, microns
                         2 - flux, in any units (this is normalized
                             for the albedo calculation)
    albedofile  = file containing three columns (as generate by the USGS):
                         1 - wavelength, in microns
                         2 - reflectance at that wavelength (0 - 1)
                         3 - error, if any
